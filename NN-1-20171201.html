</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>In non-photoreal renderings, capturing the style of an image is an extremely tricky and difficult issue. Recently there has been a
resurgence in this field with the application of Deep Learning to this problem. Specifically, in Gatys&#8217; paper, the stylization problem
is posed as an optimization problem where two cost functions capture the content distance to one image and style distance to
another image.
Gram matrix is supposed to capture the style of an artist. It had always troubled me as to why the gram matrix captures the style
of an artist. This blog entry is my understanding of that&nbsp;problem.</p>
<h2>The Genius is in the Details&nbsp;(Again)</h2>
<p>If a hidden layer at a certain point has width (w) and height (h) and if we shape the activation at a certain layer as a matrix with each row capturing the activation for a particular filter then the activation matrix on the left results (see Figure&nbsp;below).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/technical/graham_matrix1_20250315.png" alt="Description of image">
    <figcaption>Graham Matrix Computation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this case the gram matrix is defined as the matrix multiplication of the activation matrix and its&nbsp;transpose.</p>
<p>We will investigate why optimizing the gram matrix preserves the style in the context of the following style image by John Tenniel from Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland.</p>

</figure>

<p>Two Filters that may capture the low level style of the image are denoted by squares 1 and 2 (see figure&nbsp;above).</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter 1: gets activated when it sees vertical hatching pattern. Filter 2: gets activated when it sees the cross hatching&nbsp;pattern.</li>
<li>Filter 4: gets activated when it sees horizontal hatching&nbsp;pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>So, going back to the gram matrix there are two&nbsp;cases.</p>
<h2>Diagonal Entries of the Gram&nbsp;Matrix</h2>
<p>G11 encodes the vertical hatching style of the image. So, for all parts of the image that have vertical hatching have high values for
those cells. When computing the dot-product the entries get further activated. So, in the Gram matrix of this image G11 gets
activated but not G44 (since there is no horizontal hatching). This forces the cost function to create an image with vertical
hatching and not horizontal hatching.
When learning to shade using hatching typically artists use hatching to reproduce a certain tone value. This part will be done by
the content optimization part.
Similarly G22 encodes and maximizes the cross hatching for darker area of the image.
Also, if the painting was painted on a certain paper canvas then this will be captured using the diagonal part of the gram matrix.
So, G55 for the style image&nbsp;below.</p>
<h2>Non-diagonal entries in the Gram&nbsp;Matrix</h2>
<p>G12: is the dot product of the activation of filter 1 with filter 2. So, this part will get activated only if 1 and 2 overlap in certain parts
of the image. So, this can capture the cross over areas of the image. In this case it makes sure that the transition from darker to
lighter areas of the image have a way to be captured.
Regarding the canvas texture and a painting made with oil, a non-diagonal entry will also capture the fact that when the paint is
thick (lots of brush strokes), the canvas disappears. So, we will find that G56 has a really low weight while G55 and G66 have
high&nbsp;weights.</p>
