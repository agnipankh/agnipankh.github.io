    <p><strong>Gamma</strong> is the non-linearity in the <span class="caps">CRT</span> which
matches closely the non-linearity in the
human eye. It is no wonder that all display
devices now artificially embed the non-
linearity in the display. For example, a <span class="caps">DLP</span>
(digital light processing) display that is a
linear display emulates the non-linearity of
the <span class="caps">CRT</span>.</p>
<p>In this image I take advantage of the non-
linearity in a typical display which follows the
2.5 law of the&nbsp;CRTs.</p>
<p>This image is locally all gray (0.5) but I create
a gradation by locally distributing the
channels to create the color. If you want to go
technical here is an article on wikipedia (hint:
I use basically the same technique that they
use in the test chart) or better still another
one on gamma correction by the color guru
Charles&nbsp;Poynton.</p>
<p>What is really interesting about this image is
that even if you blur it a little bit, the image
disappears. So the second image is the same
image as the first and blurred with a gaussian
blur with a radius of 2&nbsp;pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Note that if you may have to download this
image and display it 1 to 1 to truly
appreciate this effect. This image has a
resolution of&nbsp;864x1145.</strong></p>
