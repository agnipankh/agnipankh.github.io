</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Sometimes, we encounter complex names for concepts we’ve been using all along. Recently, I started exploring Dempster-Shafer Theory (more on that as I learn further) and came across the&nbsp;following:</p>
<h3>Principle of Insufficient&nbsp;Reason</h3>
<p>Also known as the Principle of Indifference, which, despite sounding like a bourgeois view of the proletariat, is actually the assignment of equal probabilities to priors when no other evidence is available. For example, if no evidence is present for a coin (even if the coin might be biased), we would assign a 50/50 prior probability. This principle may have first been articulated by Bernoulli, Keynes, and possibly even&nbsp;Poincaré.</p>
<h3>Cromwell&#8217;s&nbsp;rule</h3>
<p>Another one which every practioner learns eventually but I learnt from Andrew Ng, is that we should not assign prior probabilities of 1 or 0 and only do that for statements that are logically&nbsp;true. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.
- Oliver&nbsp;Cromwell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of use of this rule is provided by Zadeh, where a patient can have a symptom because of 3 diseases A, B, and C. Doctor John says that the patient has disease A with 99.5% probability and B with 0.5% probability. Doctor Bob says that the patient has disease C with 99.5% probability and B with 0.5% probability. Given the two facts, both Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer would say that the patient has disease B. This outcome is true even if the two doctors had a probability of 99.9999% certainty. The only time we dont come up with an answer is when the probability of disease A and C is&nbsp;1. </p>
<p>I might need to spend some time considering the deeper implications of this… or perhaps it’s just scientists giving fancy names to simple&nbsp;ideas.</p>                    </article>
