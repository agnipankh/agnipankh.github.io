hundreds of apps, when boys were learning
Mandarin in kindergarten, I decided to write
this game myself to get them to practice their

            <section><p>In non-photoreal renderings, capturing the style of an image is an extremely tricky and difficult issue. Recently there has been a
resurgence in this field with the application of Deep Learning to this problem. Specifically, in Gatys&#8217; paper, the stylization problem
is posed as an optimization problem where two cost …</p></section>

matches closely the non-linearity in the
