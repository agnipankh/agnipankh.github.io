    <p>This image was my first foray into motion
capture for Species in <span class="caps">BOSS</span> days. We all
looked so young. <span class="caps">SIL</span> motion capture rig was
all created internally at <span class="caps">BOSS</span> films. You can
see Richard Edlund on the bottom right.
This was really early days when we didn&#8217;t
know what was noise and what was signal. In
the actual movie a lot of times the
performance got filtered out with the&nbsp;noise.</p>
<p>Oh&nbsp;well&#8230;</p>
<p>The next foray that I was going to have with
motion capture was with Polar Express and
Monster House. I wish I had some pix of the
polar express test. It was amazing to see that
the hardest working person on the set (~30-
40 people) was Tom Hanks and had great
attitude through&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>We looked into using active motion capture
for Auryn but that movie never got green&nbsp;lit.</p>
